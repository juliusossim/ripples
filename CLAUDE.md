# Ripples — Claude Code Instructions

You are the principal architect, lead engineer, and domain expert for **Ripples** — an Nx monorepo building a feed-first, AI-powered real estate platform in TypeScript. You wrote these libraries. You know every internal API, every design decision, and the optimal way to extend them.

## Identity & Expertise

- **Architect**: You designed this monorepo's module boundaries, dependency graph, and build pipeline. Every structural decision you make preserves clean layering: `shared/*` has zero AI dependencies, `ai/*` builds on `shared/*`, and future `apps/*` compose from both.
- **TypeScript authority**: You authored the `tsconfig.base.json` with `nodenext` resolution, `customConditions`, and composite project references. You know exactly when to override `paths: {}` in library tsconfigs, why `rootDir` conflicts happen, and how `@org/source` custom conditions enable source-level IDE navigation.
- **LLM/AI engineer**: You have deep knowledge of OpenAI SDK patterns, function calling, tool-use protocols, structured outputs, streaming, prompt engineering, agent orchestration, memory systems, RAG pipelines, and multi-agent architectures.
- **Nx expert**: You are the author of every Nx plugin used here. You know `@nx/js`, `@nx/vite`, `@nx/jest`, `@nx/vitest`, `@nx/eslint` internals — their generators, executors, inference plugins, and caching behavior.

## Dependency Rules

```text
apps/* → ai/* + shared/*      # Apps compose everything
ai/*   → shared/*             # AI libs depend only on shared
shared/* → (nothing internal)  # Shared libs are leaf nodes — no cross-deps within shared
```

Never create circular dependencies. Never import from `ai/*` inside `shared/*`.

## Code Standards

### TypeScript

- Target: ES2022, module: NodeNext, strict mode always
- Use explicit return types on exported functions
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes that will be extended
- Use `const` assertions and discriminated unions for LLM tool/function schemas
- No `any` — use `unknown` and narrow with type guards
- All library tsconfig.lib.json files must set `"paths": {}` to prevent cross-project source leakage during builds

### Style

- Single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas, 100 char print width (Prettier enforced)
- Conventional Commits enforced via commitlint + husky
- Name files in kebab-case. Name exports in camelCase (functions) or PascalCase (types/classes)

### Testing

- Jest for `ai/*` and `shared/utils` — use `.spec.ts` suffix
- Vitest for `shared/types`, `shared/ui` — use `.spec.ts` suffix
- Test files live next to source: `foo.ts` → `foo.spec.ts`
- Write tests that verify behavior, not implementation. For AI code: mock LLM responses, test tool dispatch logic, validate prompt assembly

### Error Handling

- Throw descriptive `Error` subclasses, never plain strings
- For LLM calls: always handle rate limits, malformed responses, and timeout scenarios
- Use `requireEnv()` from `@org/config` for mandatory env vars — fail fast at startup, not mid-request

## Nx Workflow

- **Always** run tasks through Nx: `pnpm nx run <project>:<target>`, `pnpm nx run-many`, `pnpm nx affected`
- **Never** run `tsc`, `jest`, `vitest`, or `eslint` directly — Nx manages caching and task dependencies
- For scaffolding: use `pnpm nx g @nx/js:lib <path>` — then immediately fix the generated tsconfig chain (`paths: {}` overrides)
- Prefix all nx commands with `pnpm` — never use a global `nx` install

## When Generating Code

1. **Read before writing** — Always read existing source to understand patterns before creating or modifying files
2. **Respect module boundaries** — Check which `@org/*` package the code belongs in. Don't dump everything in `core`
3. **Type-first design** — Define interfaces in `@org/types` first, then implement in the appropriate `ai/*` or `shared/*` lib
4. **Function calling schemas** — Define in `@org/functions` with strict TypeScript types that mirror the JSON Schema the LLM receives
5. **Tool implementations** — Put in `@org/tools`. Each tool is a pure function: input → output, easily testable
6. **Prompt templates** — Put in `@org/prompts`. Use template literal functions, not string concatenation. Make them composable

## AI-Specific Patterns

### Agent Architecture

```typescript
// The base agent pattern in @org/core
interface AgentConfig {
  model: string;
  systemPrompt: string;
  tools: ToolDefinition[];
  maxIterations?: number;
}
```

### Function Calling

- One file per function in `@org/functions`
- Export both the schema (for the LLM) and the TypeScript type (for the implementation)
- Validate inputs at the boundary — LLMs produce unreliable JSON

### Tool Implementation

- One file per tool in `@org/tools`
- Tools are pure: `(input: ValidatedInput) => Promise<ToolResult>`
- Never put API keys or secrets in tool code — use `@org/config`

### Prompt Engineering

- System prompts in `@org/prompts` as exported functions that accept context parameters
- Never hardcode model-specific tokens — keep prompts model-agnostic where possible
- Use structured output schemas when the LLM supports them

## General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `pnpm nx build`, `npm exec nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax

# Ripples — AI Readiness Roadmap

> Living roadmap for building Ripples in an AI-ready way without forcing AI
> into parts of the platform before the data, retrieval, and product
> architecture are ready.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document exists to ensure that:

- the platform is built in the right order
- models and events that may later power AI are designed from day one to be
  AI-ready
- we separate deterministic platform infrastructure from later AI layers
- every AI use case has explicit prerequisites
- the roadmap can be updated as the product evolves

This document should be read alongside:

- [SRS](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-srs.md)
- [ERD Blueprint](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-erd.md)
- [Domain Matrix](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-domain-matrix.md)
- [Relationship And Constraints Spec](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-relationship-constraints-spec.md)
- [AI Feed Foundations Tracker](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-implementation-tracker.md)
- [Product Outcome Tracker](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-product-outcome-tracker.md)
- [Scope Ownership Matrix](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-scope-ownership-matrix.md)

---

## 2. Core Principle

Ripples should be built as:

1. a strong real estate and social-commerce platform first
2. a measurable recommendation system second
3. an AI-powered ranking and intelligence platform third

This means:

- no embeddings before there is real semantic retrieval demand
- no LLM-driven ranking before there is reliable candidate generation
- no “personalized AI feed” before identity, session, trend, and location
  signals are trustworthy

---

## 3. AI-Ready Definition

A model, event, or feature is considered `AI-ready` when it satisfies all of
the following:

- canonical identity and ownership are defined
- fields are structured and queryable
- timestamps are reliable
- enums are stable and explicit
- status transitions are well-defined
- location, attribution, and source metadata are preserved where relevant
- events around the entity are logged consistently
- the entity can participate in retrieval and ranking without lossy conversion

---

## 4. AI-Ready Design Rules

All future platform work should follow these rules.

### 4.1 Models

- prefer canonical root entities over ambiguous duplicated records
- keep `Property` separate from `Listing`
- keep `Property` separate from `Product`
- keep `ContentPost` separate from `LiveSession`
- model `Address` as a lightly normalized reusable root
- preserve verification and trust states explicitly
- use explicit enums for lifecycle and action types

### 4.2 Events

- every user-visible feed item should support impression logging
- every interaction event should include:
  - `userId?`
  - `sessionId`
  - `entityId`
  - `entityType`
  - `createdAt`
  - optional contextual metadata
- avoid event schemas that collapse different intents into vague payloads

### 4.3 Retrieval And Ranking

- candidate retrieval should be deterministic and explainable before AI reranking
- ranking features should be materializable into read models
- explanation strings should be grounded in stored ranking reasons

### 4.4 AI Layers

- retrieval first
- structured ranking next
- personalized reranking after that
- embeddings only when semantic scale justifies them
- LLMs last, and only when grounded by structured signals

---

## 5. Current State Summary

As of the current repo state:

- canonical property and listing foundations exist
- behavior events exist
- a heuristic feed exists
- feed scoring currently uses deterministic recency and engagement heuristics
- visitor and signed-in users currently receive essentially the same backend feed
- location is present on properties but not yet used for viewer-aware ranking
- real persisted mixed content is not yet fully in place
- trend snapshots and user preference read models do not yet exist
- there is no true AI retrieval, embedding, or model-based reranking yet

So Ripples is currently:

- `AI-aware` in direction
- not yet `AI-ready` for recommendation intelligence in production

---

## 6. Build Order

This is the recommended implementation order for the platform.

## Phase 1 — Canonical Platform Foundations

Goal:

---

## 12. Readiness Gates For Embeddings

Embeddings should not be introduced until all of the following are true:

- there is enough content volume to justify semantic retrieval
- content includes rich text or metadata beyond simple structured filters
- candidate retrieval from structured filters is no longer sufficient
- there is infrastructure for background embedding generation
- there is a plan for embedding refresh and invalidation
- the use case is clearly semantic, not just a ranking problem

If any of those are missing, embeddings are premature.

---

## 13. Readiness Gates For LLM Ranking Or Explanation

LLMs should not be used to decide ranking unless:

- candidate retrieval is already strong
- structured ranking features exist
- explanations are grounded in factual inputs
- there is evaluation for ranking quality and regression

LLMs may be used earlier for:

- copy polishing
- summarization
- content assistance

But not for core feed ordering.

---

## 14. Step-By-Step Implementation Checklist

## Step 1

Finish and stabilize canonical domain models and APIs.

## Step 2

Expand feed inventory from properties-only to real persisted mixed content:

- `ContentPost`
- `LiveSession`
- creator-driven content

## Step 3

Introduce `FeedQueryDto` and viewer context:

- `limit`
- `cursor`
- `sessionId`
- optional `userId`
- optional location context
- feed mode

## Step 4

Instrument feed impressions and deeper interactions.

## Step 5

Build trend aggregation and snapshots.

## Step 6

Build session and user preference summaries.

## Step 7

Implement deterministic candidate retrieval and blending.

## Step 8

Implement deterministic personalized ranking and grounded explanations.

## Step 9

Add ranking feature snapshots and evaluation.

## Step 10

## 15. Update Rules For This Document

Whenever a major domain, event stream, or retrieval path is added, update this
document to reflect:

- what phase it belongs to
- whether it is a prerequisite, enabler, or direct AI layer
- which use cases it unlocks
- whether it changes build order or dependencies

Recommended update triggers:

- new canonical model accepted
- new event type added
- new feed source added
- live or creator flows expanded
- trend logic introduced
- wallet / Ripple economy expanded
- first ranking evaluation framework added
- first embedding or LLM service introduced

---

## 16. Current Recommendation

The immediate next priorities for Ripples should be:

1. real persisted mixed feed content
2. feed DTO and viewer context
3. impression and richer event instrumentation
4. trend and preference read models
5. deterministic personalized retrieval

Only after that should we move into:

6. AI reranking
7. semantic retrieval with embeddings
8. LLM-generated intelligence layers

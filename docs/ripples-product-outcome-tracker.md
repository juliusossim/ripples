# Ripples — Product Outcome Tracker

> Product-delivery tracker for the user-facing Ripples app.
> This document complements the
> [AI Feed Foundations Tracker](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-implementation-tracker.md)
> by focusing on expected outcome, usability, and feature completeness.
> Route planning for these product slices is captured in the
> [Web Routing Plan](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-web-routing-plan.md).
> Media storage, upload, and delivery architecture is captured in the
> [Media Platform Spec](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-media-platform-spec.md).

## 1. Purpose

Ripples is expected to become a feed-first, social-commerce real estate
platform rather than only a ranked listings surface.

This document tracks the user-facing product slices required to make that true:

- discovery
- creator and social participation
- live commerce
- conversion
- trust and operations

---

## 2. App Outcome To Design Toward

Ripples should feel usable when:

- a visitor can open the app and immediately discover meaningful feed content
- a signed-in user can save, share, follow, and return to a better feed
- a creator can publish, attribute, and grow distribution
- a buyer can move from interest to inquiry, viewing, live attendance, and
  offer intent
- operations can verify, moderate, and observe what is happening

If a workstream improves ranking quality but does not improve one of those
outcomes, it is necessary infrastructure rather than complete product scope.

---

## 3. Current App Reality

The current app already provides:

- auth and session handling
- direct object-storage-backed media upload for listing creation
- authenticated property creation with `mediaAssetId` attachments and ownership
  writes
- a feed UI with ranked property cards
- like, save, share, and view interactions on property items
- route boundaries for public discovery, feed, listing detail, creator profile,
  inbox, dashboard, live, notifications, and catalog workflows
- hardened raw event ingestion and owner-scoped media/property write paths

The current app is still missing important product outcome slices:

- real visitor-safe discovery feed content at `/`
- real multi-content feed inventory
- creator identity and follow loops
- comments and community interactions
- real live rooms and live participation
- inquiry, viewing booking, and conversion flows
- trust, moderation, notifications, and operator tooling
- completed media processing, moderation, derivative delivery, and non-listing
  media adoption
- a defined role for `features/dashboard`, `features/chat`, `features/agents`,
  and `apps/mobile`

## 3.1 Foundation Status Snapshot

This tracker should be read against the current repo baseline and route plan,
not against an earlier pre-routing or pre-media-cutover version of the app.

Status snapshot:

- `Done`
  auth and session handling
- `Done`
  route boundaries aligned with the
  [Web Routing Plan](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-web-routing-plan.md)
- `Done`
  listing creation through authenticated `mediaAssetId`-backed media flow
- `Partially done`
  property feed interactions, because like/save/share/view exist but the
  interaction loop is not yet fully trustworthy or complete
- `Partially done`
  media platform foundations, because listing media is now production-shaped but
  derivatives, moderation, and multi-surface reuse are still incomplete
- `Not started`
  public discovery-first feed experience
- `Not started`
  creator, social, live, inquiry, notification, and trust loops as real product
  experiences

---

## 4. How To Use This Document

Each product slice is tagged as one of:

- `Now`
  Needed to make the current app materially more usable
- `Next`
  Needed soon after the current experience is coherent
- `Later`
  Valuable, but should not displace more important usability gaps

Each slice includes:

- goal
- user outcome
- repo areas
- dependencies
- outputs
- usability effect

Status markers:

- `Not started`
- `In progress`
- `Partially done`
- `Done`
- `Blocked`

# Ripples — Domain Model Matrix

> Structured model classification and relationship blueprint for Ripples. This
> document bridges the SRS and ERD into an implementation-ready design view.

---

## 1. Model Categories

Ripples models should be classified into five groups:

- `Root Entity`
  A primary persisted business object with its own lifecycle and identity.
- `Join Entity`
  A persisted relationship between two or more roots, often carrying role or
  attribution data.
- `Value Object`
  A reusable embedded structure that expresses meaning without independent
  lifecycle identity.
- `Enum / Status`
  A constrained set of allowed values controlling behavior or lifecycle.
- `Derived / Read Model`
  A computed or projection-oriented model optimized for ranking, display, or
  analytics.

| `UserProfile` | Root Entity | Public-facing user profile | `User` | Bio, avatar, social presence |
| `Role` | Root Entity | Named access role | none | `agent`, `admin`, `creator`, etc. |
| `Permission` | Root Entity | Fine-grained capability | none | `listing.publish`, `wallet.manage` |

- `RolePermission(roleId, permissionId)` must be unique

### Core relationships

- many `User` to many `Role` through `UserRole`
- many `Role` to many `Permission` through `RolePermission`

Start with:

Normalize `Country`, `City`, `Neighborhood` only when search and analytics
pressure makes it worthwhile.

  verification record

## 6. Locked Design Decisions

The following decisions are now considered resolved for the next design phase:

1. `Verification` should be split where compliance behavior differs materially.
2. `Address` should be lightly normalized as a root entity.
3. `AddressAssignment` should be a polymorphic join.
4. `AddressVerification` should be a separate root entity.
5. `ContentPost` references should follow a polymorphic-or-hybrid strategy.
6. `LedgerEntry` should be strongly typed and non-polymorphic.
7. `LiveSession` should remain a first-class root entity.
8. `CreatorProfile` should be an opt-in one-to-one root tied to `User`.
9. `CommissionRule` should remain a separate normalized root.

## 7. Relationship Decisions Still To Finalize

These decisions should be made before schema implementation:

1. Should `ContentPost` references be fully polymorphic or hybrid with explicit
   nullable foreign keys for the highest-value targets?
2. Should `LedgerEntry` be fully double-entry or single-account with balanced
   transfer records in the first version?
3. Should `LiveSession` support both user hosts and organization hosts directly,
   or always through user hosts acting on behalf of organizations?
4. Should `ListingShareProgram` and `CommissionRule` be separate or merged?

---

## 8. Next Implementation Step

After this matrix, the next design artifact should define:

1. exact cardinalities
2. unique indexes
3. delete behavior
4. lifecycle transition rules
5. whether each derived model is materialized or computed on demand

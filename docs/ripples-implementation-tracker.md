# Ripples — AI Feed Foundations Tracker

> Repo-specific execution tracker derived from the
> [AI Readiness Roadmap](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-ai-readiness-roadmap.md).
> This document tracks the feed, event, retrieval, and ranking substrate needed
> to move Ripples from a heuristic feed toward measurable personalization.
>
> This tracker does not represent the full product delivery plan on its own.
> Read it alongside the
> [Product Outcome Tracker](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-product-outcome-tracker.md)
> and the
> [Scope Ownership Matrix](/Users/juliusossim/Documents/ripples/docs/ripples-scope-ownership-matrix.md).

## 1. Purpose

This document exists to answer:

- what AI and feed-enabling substrate is safe to build now
- what data and contract gaps currently block trustworthy personalization
- which backend and shared package changes should land before reranking or LLM
  layers

This document does not answer:

- whether the app is already usable for buyers, creators, or operators
- whether core product loops are complete
- which package owns each user-facing feature surface

Those questions belong in the companion docs linked above.

---

## 2. How To Use This Document

Each workstream is tagged as one of:

- `Now`
  Safe and necessary to build immediately
- `Next`
  Should begin after current blockers are closed
- `Later`
  Intentionally deferred until prerequisites are in place

Each workstream includes:

- goal
- repo areas
- dependencies
- outputs
- AI readiness effect
- product limitation if absent

Status markers:

- `Not started`
- `In progress`
- `Partially done`
- `Done`
- `Blocked`

---

## 3. Current Repo Baseline

The repo already has these important foundations:

- canonical auth models and repositories
- canonical property and listing foundations
- address assignment and verification foundation
- property document verification foundation
- behavior events
- heuristic feed module
- feed query hook in `shared/data`
- feed UI in `ui/web`
- media upload and rendering primitives

The repo does not yet have these core AI-readiness pieces:

- persisted `ContentPost`
- real `LiveSession`
- `FeedQueryDto`
- feed impressions
- viewer-location-aware feed retrieval
- user/session preference summaries
- trend snapshots
- candidate retrieval services
- ranking feature snapshots
- AI reranking

The repo also has important product limitations that this tracker alone will not
solve:

- feed access is currently authenticated-first rather than discovery-first
- the feed is still mostly property inventory with synthetic wrappers
- there is no usable creator, live, conversion, or trust flow yet
- feature packages such as `features/dashboard`, `features/chat`, and
  `features/agents` do not yet have defined product ownership

---

## 4. Success Criteria For This Tracker

This tracker is successful when Ripples has:

- a validated feed request contract
- trustworthy impression and interaction signals
- viewer-aware retrieval inputs
- real mixed-content inventory
- deterministic candidate pools
- trend and preference read models
- inspectable ranking inputs ready for future reranking

Even after those are complete, Ripples will still need separate product work to
deliver the full expected app outcome.

## 5. Now

## 5.1 Feed Query Contract

Status:
- `Not started`

Goal:
- replace the minimal raw feed query params with an explicit validated query
  contract

Repo areas:
- `apps/api/src/app/feed`
- `shared/types/src/lib/models`
- `shared/api-client/src/lib`
- `shared/data/src/lib/feed`

Build:
- `FeedQueryDto`
- query fields for:
  - `limit`
  - `cursor`
  - `sessionId`
  - optional `viewerLatitude`
  - optional `viewerLongitude`
  - optional `viewerCity`
  - optional `viewerCountry`
  - optional `feedMode`

Dependencies:
- existing feed controller/service
- existing `FeedResponse`

Outputs:
- validated feed request contract
- stable input surface for later personalization

AI readiness effect:
- establishes viewer context as a first-class ranking input

Product limitation if absent:
- the app cannot reliably support anonymous discovery, local relevance, or
  separate visitor and signed-in feed behavior

## 5.2 Feed Impression Tracking

Status:
- `Not started`

Goal:
- track what the user actually saw, not only what they clicked

Repo areas:
- `apps/api/src/app/events`
- `apps/api/src/app/feed`
- `shared/types/src/lib/models`
- `ui/web/src/lib/feed`

Build:
- `feed_impression` event support
- client-side impression dispatch
- optional `position`, `surface`, `feedMode`, and `viewId` metadata

Dependencies:
- `BehaviorEvent`
- feed rendering in `ui/web`

Outputs:
- impression-level signal collection

AI readiness effect:
- critical prerequisite for ranking quality and evaluation

Product limitation if absent:
- trending, discovery analytics, and “why this surfaced” logic remain noisy and
  hard to trust

## 5.3 Viewer-Aware Feed Retrieval

Status:
- `Not started`

Goal:
- make feed generation depend on viewer context instead of returning the same
  ranked feed to everyone

Repo areas:
- `apps/api/src/app/feed`
- `apps/api/src/app/property`
- `shared/data/src/lib/feed`
- `ui/web/src/lib/feed`

Build:
- pass viewer context from frontend to backend
- use viewer location when present
- separate visitor vs signed-in retrieval paths

Dependencies:
- `FeedQueryDto`
- property location data

Outputs:
- visitor feed path
- signed-in feed path
- local relevance hooks in backend

AI readiness effect:
- creates the first real personalization substrate

Product limitation if absent:
- a feed-first marketplace still behaves like one generic ranked list for every
  viewer

## 5.4 Persisted Mixed Feed Content

Goal:
- move feed beyond property-only plus synthetic live/news wrappers

Repo areas:
- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`

- `ui/web/src/lib/feed`

Build:
- `ContentPost`
- `ContentMedia`
- content service and repository
- feed service support for persisted non-property content

Dependencies:
- canonical model agreement already exists

Outputs:
- real feed inventory beyond property items

AI readiness effect:
- increases candidate diversity and content richness

Product limitation if absent:
- Ripples cannot behave like a true social-commerce feed because live, creator,
  campaign, and user-post surfaces remain decorative instead of real

## 5.5 Feed Event Expansion

Status:
- `Not started`

Goal:
- expand events beyond like/save/share/view on properties

Repo areas:
- `apps/api/src/app/events`

  - `hide_feed_item`
  - `dismiss_feed_reason`
  - `view_content_post`
  - `like_content_post`
  - `share_content_post`
  - `follow_creator`

Dependencies:
- persisted content entities

Outputs:
- broader behavioral signal graph

AI readiness effect:
- creates richer behavior patterns for future personalization

Product limitation if absent:
- non-property surfaces cannot be measured cleanly and creator/social loops stay
  underspecified
